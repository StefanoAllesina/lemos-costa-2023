# Code and data accompanying Lemos-Costa et al. 2023

Contents:

- **code** code to fit the statistical models as well as the randomizations; code to organize raw results (removing duplicate randomized trees)

- **data** raw data from original publications; code to parse and organize the raw data

- **resuts** resulting model fits and randomizations; typically, each model/data set is fitted several times, including about 100 randomizations (will take about 1 day to run on a recent computer); by running several times in parallel, with different random seeds, one can collect a large number of randomizations. For example, many files containing randomizations for Cadotte (2013) model 1 are provided.

- **organized_results** organized results for each data set/model combination, obtained by merging several files containing randomizations and removing duplicate randomized trees.

- **code_figures_tables** code to reproduce the figures and tables in the manuscript.
